This file will demostrate how to use basic function in scikit-learn

sklearn is model name of scikit-learn.
scikit-learn has contained some dataset, such as  iris and digits.

    """
    Give a fixed parameter to initialize svm model, return a classifier.
    SVC is C-Support Vector Classification.

    clf = svm.SVC(gamma = 0.001, C = 100)
    """
    Use all the images of our dataset apart from the last one to train model.
    fit() function will perform optimization procedure.

    Predict a new image which does not use to train model.

    Two way to save model: pickle and joblib.
    Use joblibâ€™s replacement of pickle (joblib.dump & joblib.load), 
    which is more efficient on big data, 
    but can only pickle to the disk and not to a string.
    
    joblib.dump returns a list of filenames. 
    Each individual numpy array contained in the clf object 
    is serialized as a separate file on the filesystem.
    All files are required in the same folder
    when reloading the model with joblib.load.
